# Credit Card Fraud Detection

<p> With millions of credit card transactions being processed, financial fraud is increasing, putting the company at high risk. Traditional rule-based fraud detection systems are failing to adapt to new fraud techniques. Companies might seeks a machine learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions in real time, with minimal false positives.<p/>

•	Data pre-processing and cleaning for each dataset.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python(Jupiter notebook) and Numpy, Matplot Lib, Seaborn.
•	Implementation of machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
•	Testing same models on Hyperparameter tuning for improving results.
•	Evaluating models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
•	Testing final best model on unseen dataset (test dataset).
